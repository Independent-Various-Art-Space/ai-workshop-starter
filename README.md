# AI for Web Programming Workshop Template

Welcome to the official starter template for the AI for Web Programming workshop, hosted by Racelar Ho. This repository contains a complete, functional portfolio website that will serve as our foundation for exploring AI-assisted development.

## About This Template

This is a static website built with standard web technologies. The goal of the workshop is not to build this site from scratch, but to learn how to intelligently modify and enhance it using an AI collaborator like Gemini. We will focus on customising text, changing styles, and adding new interactive elements.

### Core Technologies
*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the website.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, layout, and visual appearance.
*   **JavaScript (with jQuery):** For interactivity, animations, and dynamic behaviour.

## How to Use This Template

Please follow these steps to get started.

### 1. Get the Code

You can either download the code as a ZIP file or clone the repository using Git.

*   **To Download:** Click the green `<> Code` button on this page, then select `Download ZIP`. Unzip the file to a location on your computer, such as your Desktop.
*   **To Clone (Recommended):** If you have Git installed, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/[Your-GitHub-Username]/ivas-ai-workshop-template.git
    ```

### 2. Explore the Files

Once you have the files, open the folder in your code editor (e.g., WebStorm, VS Code). You will see several key files and folders:

*   `index-fullscreen-agency-image.html`: **This is the main file we will be working on during the workshop.** It represents a complete single-page portfolio.
*   `css/`: This folder contains the stylesheets. `main.css` is where most of the design rules are located.
*   `js/`: This folder contains the JavaScript files. `custom.js` is where we can add our own interactive scripts.
*   `img/`: This folder holds all the images for the template.

### 3. View the Website Locally

To see the website in action, simply find the `index-fullscreen-agency-image.html` file in your computer's file explorer and double-click it. It will open in your default web browser.

### 4. Prepare for AI Collaboration

The primary activity of our workshop will be to modify this template using prompts given to an AI. Here are some examples of tasks we will perform:

*   **Modifying Content:** We will ask the AI to generate new headlines and descriptive text to replace the placeholder content in the `.html` file.
*   **Changing Styles:** We will ask the AI to provide new CSS rules to change colours, fonts, and layouts in the `.css` file.
*   **Adding Interactivity:** We will ask the AI to write new JavaScript functions to add creative effects, such as making elements react to mouse movements or clicks.

The goal is to learn the process of creative dialogue with an AI to bring your artistic vision to life on the web. I look forward to building with you all.
